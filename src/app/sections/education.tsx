                        I am a Software Engineering student at Instituto Tecnol√≥gico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey (ITESM) in Hermosillo, Sonora, Mexico. I have been studying here since 2021, and during this time, I have built a strong foundation in various programming languages, algorithms, data structures, and software development.

                        I am passionate about learning new technologies, particularly in DevSecOps. Additionally, I actively participate in extracurricular activities such as coding competitions and hackathons, where I can demonstrate my skills and collaborate with other students.
